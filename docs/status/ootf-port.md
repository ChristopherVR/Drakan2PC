# Order of the Flame in the PS2 engine: status

Living tracker (updated 2026-11-02). Drakan 1 (Order of the Flame, PC) levels are converted from the player's own install into mod
packs that the recompiled PS2 engine plays; nothing from either game is committed. Detail lives in the dated notes under
`docs/journal/2026-10-31/` and `docs/journal/2026-11-01/` (`ootf-*.md`, `arena-*.md`, `game-select-ootf-boot.md`); formats are in the
`editor/packages/formats` submodule, pack rules in `reference/modding.md` ("Campaign packs").

## What works

* Converter `editor/scripts/ootf-convert.ts` (`--campaign 1` for the campaign): terrain, textures, models, creatures (skinned, retargeted
  to PS2 rigs), classes, puzzles (plates, doors, counters), exits, texts, music, sounds. Release packs of 2026-11-02: campaign
  `ootf-levels` (13 levels, 9119 files) and arenas `ootf-arenas` (10 levels, 158 files, one `maps/*.ini` each).
* Game choice at the title ("Choose your game": Drakan / Drakan: Order of the Flame, `drakan.ini [general] game = ask|d2|d1`), a
  campaign-only New Game that starts at `OotF 00 - Intro` (no Drakan 2 intro), separate save cards, Order of the Flame title plaque.
* All 13 campaign levels load and run; level exits work by walking into converted exit boxes (`exitBoxes`) and by the host-fired
  `DRAKAN_LEVELCHANGE` path, including the Volcanic hops. Intro -> Ruined Village verified from the title with the packs installed.
* Ten multiplayer arenas as maps tagged `Drakan 1 / CUSTOM` (4 air, 3 ground, 3 QOD-style), dragon-vs-dragon breath PvP in the air
  arenas (host-claimed hits, dragon health, death, respawn), ranged and melee PvP on ground arenas.
* Co-op stays on the Drakan campaign path and shares the New Game card; the OotF Multiplayer page has Host / Join / mplayer.com only.
* HD textures for both packs (`analysis/scripts/ootf_hd_pack.py <zips>`, output under `dist/DrakanPC/textures`, never committed).
  The converter still quantises object textures above 128 px to 8 bpp because the guest's 32 bpp mip loop is slow; an opt-in native
  filter (`DRAKAN_TEXSCALE=1`, `ootf-native-mips.md`) removes the cost but stalls the heap intermittently (Islands Night), so it is off.
* Drakan 2 with both packs installed still boots normally (choose Drakan; `Level 0 - Intro` then `Level 1A - Surdana`; no OotF leakage).

## Known gaps

* Dragon breath in the air arenas draws no flame or particle (the engine's breath effect was not found); dragon health regeneration
  lifts the bar between hits; a dying dragon hangs frozen until respawn (`ootf-dragon-pvp.md`).
* The real PC triggers were not walked: Islands Detector 4131, Volcanic Detector 2318 (mount only), Succubus `ship2`. The placed exit
  boxes are the tested path (`ootf-link-regression.md`).
* Volcanic runs at about 42 fps with the rift effect live (Vortex / Inner / Outer Rift movers).
* The exit scan cannot resolve level-local destination strings of converted levels; use the exit index with `DRAKAN_LEVELCHANGE`.
* Two packs installed together share patched files (`RESOURES.MOD/.TXD`, `PROCTEES.TXD`, `WORLDCON.*`, `RESOURES.SDB` entries): the
  later pack wins and logs conflicts. Convert campaign and arenas together instead (no level paths = all 23 levels in one pack); for separate packs keep `ootf-levels` after `ootf-arenas` in `mods.ini`; arena models missing from the campaign
  copy were not checked in a full arena match with both packs installed.
* The Host Game mode strip still shows a disabled Co-op tile ("Coming") beside the PvP modes.
* The Ruined Village arrival fade is black for a few seconds after a host-fired exit; the arrival marker placement and a walked exit
  between levels were only checked for some pairs.
* Map-file key for an adopted loadout item (the ini only knows factory resources), `arena-pvp-open-items.md`.
* Duplicate-object warnings from source data (Alwarren, Grimstone Mines) are harmless but unexamined.

* 2026-11-02 state proofs (`journal/2026-11-02/ootf-state-proofs.md`): switch -> portcullis and plate -> mover chains proven by world dumps; Dr. Evil: 3 of 4 heads killed in game, ending not reached (4th head stayed 22000 units away); dying dragon now falls; breath visual still open.
* 2026-11-02 pass (`journal/2026-11-02/ootf-unproven-creatures-chains.md`): Succubus drawn; Blade Dragons alive and attacking; Queen / Hueges alive;
  Ebon Dragon / Drone / switch-to-portcullis still unproven by picture; the pack conflict is fixed by one combined conversion (`journal/2026-11-02/ootf-combined-pack.md`).
